Below is a running list of Unix commands and common arguments as used in Intro to Biocomputation Fall 2017.

**`man`** -- format and display the on-line manual pages

- `man` expects a function/command name as an argument

**`ls`** -- list directory contents

- `ls` expects a directory path as an argument, but if none is provided `.` is used

- `-a`: list all files, including hidden files

- `-F`: display slashes behind directories

- `-l`: include information about date of creation and file size

- `-h`: when used with `-l` this makes the file sizes human readable with varied units

- `-r`: reverse the sorted order of the files listed

- `-t`: sort by time modified

**`cd`** -- change directory

- `cd` expects a path for the directory you would like to change to your present workind directory

**`pwd`** -- present working directory

- `pwd` expects no argument and returns the path to your current working directory

**`mkdir`** -- make directory

- `mkdir` expects a directory name in order to create it

- `-p`: creates intermediate directories if a directory within other non-existent directories is specified

**`rm`** -- remove

- `rm` expects a path to a file or directory to be removed

- `-r`: remove recursively, removes directories and their contents

- `-i`: request confirmation before attempting to remove each file

**`sort`** -- sort lines of text files

- `-d`: dictionary sort

- `-k`: which key (field or column) to sort lines by; this flag should be followed by a number; white space delineates columns

- `-n`: numeric sort

- `-r`: sort in reverse order

- `-u`: remove duplicate entries and return a sorted set of lines

**`cut`** -- cut out selected portions of each line of a file

- `-d`: use the provided delimiter for fields/columns

- `-f`: which fields to return; note that this can be more than one field separated by commas

&nbsp;

**`cat`** -- concatenate and print files

- `cat` expects one or more file names as an argument

- `-b`: print line numbers for non-blank lines

- `-n`: number all output lines

**`echo`** -- write arguments to standard out

 - `-n`: do not print a trialing new line character

**`less** -- text viewing utility

- `less` allows scrolling through a file, but no editting of the file

- `-N`: display line numbers

- `-S`: do not wrap lines

**`wc`** -- word, line, character, and byte count

- `wc` expects one or more input file(s)

- `-c`: output the number of bytes

- `-l`: output the number of lines

- `-m`: output the number of characters

- `-w`: output the number of words

**`uniq`** -- filter out sequential repeated lines in a file

- NOTE: the input should be sorted first if you want to remove all duplicates, not only sequential duplicates

- `-c`: precede each output line with the count of the number of times the line occurred in the input

- `-d`: only output lines that are repeated in the input

- `-u`: only output lines that are not repeated in the input

- `-i`: case insensitive comparison

**`grep`** -- file pattern searcher

- `-c`: only a count of selected lines is written to stdout

- `--colour`: mark up the matching text with a color

- `-E`: interpret the pattern as an extended regular expression

- `-F`: interpret the pattern as a fixed string; don't use the special meaning of special characters or wildcards

- `-i`: ignore case

- `-m`: stop reading the file after the specified number of matches

- `-n`: each output is preceded by the line number in the original file

- `-v`: invert match; return non-matching lines

- `-w`: only match the pattern if it is a complete word

&nbsp;

**`find`** -- walk and search a file hierarchy

- `-type`: type of object to search for; can be `d` directory, `f` file, etc.

- `-name`: a pattern can be specified after this argument to only find files matching that pattern

**`sed`** -- stream editor (find and replace)

- `-E`: interpret patterns as extended regular expressions

- the most commonly used forms of commands for sed are:

    + `'s/pattern/replacement/'`
        
        + this command can be followed by g - global or N - replace the Nth match
    
    + `'y/abc/xyz/'`


**`tr`** -- translate characters

- `tr` expects two arguments *string1* and *string2*

- `-d`: delete characters in string1 from the input

**`history`** -- return a history of commands entered at the prompt

- `history` does not expect any arguments
