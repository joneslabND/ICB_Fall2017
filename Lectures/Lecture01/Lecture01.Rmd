## Course Philosophy

- Teach you enough to be dangerous!  
- Focus on exposure and general solutions rather than mastery of a particular tool 
- Allow you to recognize when to use tools  
- Not a bioinformatics, statistics, or modeling course (but those are available)  

## Learning Goals

1. Use of a powerful means to interact with local and remote computers (Unix)

2. Scripting using Python or R

3. Best practices and applications

We'll spend approximately 1/3 of the semester on each of these goals!

## Two principle aspects of programming

1. Conceptual building blocks -- the focus of lecture (MW)

2. Language-specific syntax -- the focus of tutorials (F)

## Class preparation

- No book
- Readings or activities before many class meetings
- Readings and assignments will be available on Sakai
- Materials also on GitHub - https://github.com/joneslabND/ICB_Fall2017

## Sakai

- Announcements
- Resources
- Forum

## Components of the Course
Lots of moving parts because we are covering a lot of ground.

Each of these components are designed and included to enhance your learning!

1.  Quizzes
2.  Good & Bad
3.  Graded Exercises
4.  Group Projects
5.  Final Exam

## Tutorial sections

- doesn't matter what section you are registered for

- what are you more interested in right now - R or Python?

- we'll let you know before Friday where to go, but we won't cover scripting for a few weeks

## For Friday
- look at first episode of Shell Lesson on Software Carpentry
- download required files
- OSX and Linux users are all set; Windows users need to install CygWin
