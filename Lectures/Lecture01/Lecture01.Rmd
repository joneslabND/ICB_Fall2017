## Course Philosophy

- Teach you enough to be dangerous!  
- Focus on exposure and general solutions rather than mastery of a particular tool 
- Allow you to recognize when to use tools  
- Not a bioinformatics, statistics, or modeling course (but those are available)  

## Learning Goals

1. Use of a powerful means to interact with local and remote computers (Unix)

2. Scripting using Python or R

3. Best practices and applications

We'll spend approximately 1/3 of the semester on each of these goals!

## Two principle aspects of programming

1. Conceptual building blocks -- the focus of lecture (MW)

2. Language-specific syntax -- the focus of tutorials (F)

## Class preparation

- No book
- Readings or activities before many class meetings
- Readings and assignments will be available on Sakai
- Materials also on GitHub - https://github.com/joneslabND/ICB_Fall2017

## Sakai

- Announcements
- Resources
- Forum

## Components of the Course
Lots of moving parts because we are covering a lot of ground.

Each of these components are designed and included to enhance your learning!

1.  Quizzes
2.  Good & Bad
3.  Graded Exercises
4.  Group Projects
5.  Final Exam

## Tutorial sections

- doesn't matter what section you are registered for

- what are you more interested in right now - R or Python?

- we'll let you know before Friday where to go, but we won't cover scripting for a few weeks

## What's Unix?
- A set of simple, modular tools that work on files organized in a filesystem
- Allows for multitasking and "time sharing"
- Developed in the C programming language at Bell Labs in the 1970's
- Since its development, variations have been created including the open-source Linux and the basis of Mac OSX (Darwin and macOS)
- The "GNUS's Not Unix" (GNU) project was instrumental in expansion of the open-source Lnux and development of a large number of open-source libraries used today

## Why Unix?
- Efficient 
- Multi-tasking
- Modularity allows for user creation of powerful tools
- Portable and easy for communication with other computers, including large computing resources

## How does Unix work?
- A *shell* interprets commands provided by the user and passes them to the *kernel*, which does all of the work in the operating system
- These commands are often built from a set of existing functions, but can also be custom written by users
- A user can interact with the shell from the command line or write shell scripts in order to automate processes
- The majority of the work done by the kernel fits the pattern of reading a file line-by-line, transforming contents of the file in some way, and writing to a new file

## The Unix shell
- Lots of versions of Unix shells have been developed over the years
    + *sh* was the original shell developed at Bell Labs
    + *sh* was upgraded in the late 1970's, but then completely rewritten as the Bourne shell
    + The Bourne-Again shell, *bash* is a GNU Project version of the Bourne shell and is very common today
    + Other common shell varieties you might encounter are C shell, *csh*, and TENEX C shell, *tcsh*

## Looking ahead
- Friday's tutorial
    + look at first episode of Shell Lesson on Software Carpentry
    + download required files
    + OSX and Linux users are all set; Windows users need to install CygWin

- Next week
    + continue working through Shell Lesson on Software Carpentry
    + quizzes on Monday and Wednesday
