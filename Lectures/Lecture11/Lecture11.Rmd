\begincols
  \begincol{.48\textwidth}
  
  &nbsp;
  
  &nbsp;
  
  `read.table()` loads tabular data as dataframe
  
  &nbsp;
  
  `scan()` loads data as a vector; each line is an element
  
  \endcol
  \begincol{.48\textwidth}
  
  `numpy.loadtxt()` works for tabular data of the same type
  
  &nbsp;
  
  `pandas.read_csv()` loads tabular data as dataframe
  
  &nbsp;
  
  we can also directly open a file and access its contents with `open()`
