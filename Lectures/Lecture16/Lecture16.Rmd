## Stuart's version of statistics

My (short) version of statistics relies on two concepts:

&nbsp;

- random variables

- linear, and sometimes simple non-linear, models

## Random variables

&nbsp;

- a way to quantify the outcomes of a random process

- a way to map a random process to numbers

&nbsp;

**Repeated quantification of the same random process begets a probability distribution!**

## Probability distributions

&nbsp;

- describe a variety of random processes and therefore have a number of different characteristics and shapes

- can be used to test hypotheses or models

## Probability distributions

## Probability distributions

&nbsp;

- describe a variety of random processes and therefore have a number of different characteristics and shapes

- can be used to test hypotheses or models

- we can do this using something called a **Likelihood**

&nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; `L(model|data) = P(data|model)`

## Example with coin flips

Imagine we flipped a coin twice and got two heads...

&nbsp;

What are a couple hypothesis or models for our coin?

## Example with coin flips

What is the likelihood of our two models?

## Example with coin flips

What is the likelihood of our two models?

&nbsp;

What if we flipped 8 more times and got 3 heads and 5 tails?

&nbsp;

What is the likelihood of our two models?

## Linear models

&nbsp;

- familiar with the equation for a line?

- that is a linear model, but isn't exactly what is meant by a "linear model"...

- how did Kelly *et al*. use linear models?

## linear models + probability distributions = biological hypothesis testing

&nbsp;

our coin flip example didn't include a linear model, but it did have a probability distribution

&nbsp;

so far our discussion of Kelly *et al*. 2014 hasn't had a probability distribution, but how might we add one?

## what does adding this probability distribution accomplish?

## what does adding this probability distribution accomplish?

- accounts for "variation"
  
    + measurement error
  
    + genetic variation across populations
  
    + variation in growth rate across individuals
  
    + etc.

- allows us to compare one model to another, including a null (purely random) model

    + do this using Likelihoods
    
## Wednesday

&nbsp;

talk about how to translate our models into code and confront with data

&nbsp;

practice with some data from Kelly *et al*. 2014 and other examples
