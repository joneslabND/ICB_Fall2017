## What does bioinformatics mean to you?

## At a practical level, what is bioinformatics?

## At a practical level, what is bioinformatics?

- installing tools

- figuring out how to use tools

- reformating files

- searching for patterns

## Compiled vs. interpreted languages

- **Compiled** - source code is translated to computer-understandable instructions once prior to its use. The compiling process is specific to a given computer based on its hardware, operating system, etc. Examples include C, C++, and sometimes Java.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- **Interpreted** - human-readable code is read and evaluated by an interpreter each time it is run. However, the interpreter itself is a compiled program. Examples include Python, R, and Perl.

## Source code vs. binaries

- **Source code** - this is often written in a compiled language and must be *compiled* on your machine. Many times these tools will have *dependencies* that may or may not be included with the source code. A common tool for distributing and compiling biocomputational tools is called `make`, usually three steps are required - `./configure`, `make`, `make install`.

&nbsp;

- **Binaries** - these are previously compiled versions of the tool. These are operating system specific and sometimes may not work for your system because they were compiled on a different system. However, when these are available and work for you, it allows you to avoid the sometimes difficult compiling process.

## Installing tools

This week one tool we will use is an aligner called `Muscle`.  This tool is available for free on the creator's website:

https://www.drive5.com/muscle/downloads.htm

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

We'll also be using a pattern matching tool called `hmmer`. This tool is also available for free on the web:

http://hmmer.org/download.html

## Installing tools - example

Often the tools come in a compressed format to make it easier to download. In Unix this compressed format is called a "tarball" because the function used to generate the compressed file is `tar`. Thes "tarballs" are often also "zipped" to further compress them. As a result many tools you download will have the file names like *toolname.tar.gz*.

&nbsp;

We have to "unpack" these compressed files to use the tools. This is accomplished using two tools (`gzip` and `tar`).

`gzip -d toolname.tar.gz`, which will "unzip" our file leaving us with a new file `toolname.tar`

`tar -xf toolname.tar`, which will "untar" our file leaving us with our tool or a directory containing components of our tool

## How do we figure out how to use tools?

## Sequence alignment

Sequence alignment attempts to evaluate the level of sequence conservation or *homology* amongst a set of sequences. Once aligned the sequences can be used to evaluate genetic change and to infer evolutionary history.

## Profile Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

HMMs have been used to conduct flexible and fast sequence comparisons in a probabalistic framework.

For a simple model that does not allow for insertions or deletions, the probability of a given amino acid or nucleic acid is given.

## Profile Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

This simple profile HMM is also sometimes depicted as a sequence with the size of the residue proportional to its probability.

## Profile Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

More complex profile HMMs allow for insertions or deletions of amino acids or nucleic acids.

## Reformating files and searching for patterns

You've done some of this already!

&nbsp;

What were some tools we could use to do this?

## Wednesday

&nbsp;

practice the use of these new tools, as well as using Unix and Python/R functionality to complete some bioinformatics

&nbsp;

**Download and "install" Muscle and hmmer3 for Wednesday**

- download correct version for your OS; Muscle for Cygwin - use the Windows binaries

- run within Unix/Cygwin
    
- put them somewhere easy to find in Unix/Cygwin
    
- don't forget you may need a `./` to execute the command
    
- you know they work if you can run the version (-v) or help (-h) option
