## pipes - linking output to input of next function or filter

- functions transform a stream of input into a stream of output and are refered to as filters
 
- pipes stitch these filters together sequentially and facilitate **orthoganol design**

- when creating your own functions/scripts/programs in Unix it is useful to maintain orthoganol design
    + take input from `stdin` 
    
    + write to `stdout`
    
    + in other words make filters that can be connected with pipes

## assignment or redirection
- Often we want to capture or store the results of a series of filters and pipes

- Is `stdout` useful for this purpose?

- What options do we have for capturing filter-pipe output?
    + `stdout` vs. redirection to a file
    + `>`, `<`, `>>`
    + don't use the same file name as input!!!

## pipes - quiz question 2
`cat numbers.txt | wc > counts.txt`

`cat` writes the content of `numbers.txt` to **stdout**, which is **piped** as **stdin** to `wc`. The **filter** `wc` counts the number of lines, words, and characters received from **stdin** and writes these values to **stdout**. **stdout** is then redirected to the file `counts.txt`.

## building pipelines
- problem decomposition is key (a theme that will be revisited over and over)

- step-by-step

- build sequentially and look at intermediate products at each step

## printing and viewing options
- `cat`

- `less`

- `wc`

## building pipelines
`cat animals.txt`

`cat animals.txt | wc`

`cat animals.txt | cut -d , -f 2 | less`

`cat animals.txt | cut -d , -f 2 | wc`

`cat animals.txt | cut -d , -f 2 | sort -r | less`

`cat animals.txt | cut -d , -f 2 | sort -r > final.txt`

`cat final.txt`

## build a pipeline
Given the file `animals.txt`. What are the number of unique animal observations across the data collection?

## automate the process for files of the same form
Wildcards (`*`, `?`) provide an opportunity to evaluate a number of files with similar structure all at once.

This is powerful, but with great power comes great responsibility...

## function review
`wc`

`sort`

`head`

`tail`

`uniq`

`cut`
